%UNTITLED M-file for untitled.fig
%      UNTITLED, by itself, creates a new UNTITLED or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = UNTITLED returns the handle to a new UNTITLED or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      UNTITLED('Property','Value',...) creates a new UNTITLED using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to untitled_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      UNTITLED('CALLBACK') and UNTITLED('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in UNTITLED.M with the given input
%      arguments.
